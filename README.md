# Hello-World
I'm Wolffie. I'm smart, enthusiastic, and have a lot of pothential and engergy. However, I'm 51 and don't have a job so I'm worried that nobody will be interested in hiring me. I reached a year of sobriety the other day. I hadn't been sober for three straight weeks since I've been 14. I feel great and sharp as ever!
